OOP 3200 Lab 3
This lab was a collaboration between Daniel Hinbest and Ryan Clayson in Object-Oriented Programming II (OOP 3200) at Durham College. The assignment was to create a C++ console application that creates a deck of cards and create functions to allow the program to shuffle the deck, draw the cards in order, or randomly.
